        <h3>dice roller</h3>
        <p>
            One of the first programs I ever wrote was an equation-based dice roller written in objective-c. 
            Over the years I have revisited the concept several times, sometimes improving it and sometimes 
            just experimenting. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is my current one written in javascript a few years ago and integrated into my personal website. 
            It sees regular use when I am playing dice-based tabletop games.
